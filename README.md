## 🔑 Your Configuration

**Wallet Address:** `0xf9909beA4c20A9d44e053122fcEd2A5A68F87Fc9`

**Testnet RPC:** `https://weathered-side-haze.bsc-testnet.quiknode.pro/...`

**Mainnet RPC:** `https://fittest-billowing-rain.bsc.quiknode.pro/...`

**Get Testnet BNB:** https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart

---

## ⚡️ How It Works

```
User signs payment (0 gas!) → Your API verifies → BSC executes → ✅ Done!
```

Your relayer wallet pays the gas fees (~$0.15 per transaction)
